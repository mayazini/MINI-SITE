                This project started years ago when I was just a kid.
                <br />
                <br />
                After five years of hard work and determination we got our first inverstor.
                <br />
                <br />
                Bill Gates, 3 billion dollars for 3% of our company.
                <br />
                <br />
                Here, we give people an opportunity, a place of comfort and hope of making their dreams come true.
                <br />
                <br />
                Don't be afraid to do what you love!
